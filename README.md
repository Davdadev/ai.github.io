			<h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
			<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.</p>

		<section id="history">
			<h2>A Brief History of AI</h2>
			<p>The history of AI goes back to the early days of computing, when scientists and engineers began to explore the possibilities of building machines that could think and reason like humans. The first AI programs were developed in the 1950s, and since then, the field has grown rapidly, with major breakthroughs in machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics.</p>

				<h3>New AI System Can Predict COVID-19 Outcomes</h3>
				<p>A team of researchers at MIT has developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) system that can predict COVID-19 outcomes with a high degree of accuracy. The system uses data from electronic health records and other sources to identify patients who are at high risk of developing severe symptoms, and can help healthcare providers make more informed decisions about treatment and care.</p>
